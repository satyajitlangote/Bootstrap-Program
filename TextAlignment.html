        statement with that name at the top of every source file that contains the classes, interfaces, 
        enumerations, and annotation types that you want to include in the package. The package 
        statement should be the first line in the source file. There can be only one package statement 
        in each source file, and it applies to all types in the file.  If a package statement is not used 
        then the class, interfaces, enumerations, and annotation types will be put into an unnamed 
        package. 
        A java package is a group of similar types of classes, interfaces and sub-packages. 
        Package in java can be categorized in two form, built-in package and user-defined package. 
        There are many built-in packages such as java, lang, awt, javax, swing, net, io, util, sql etc. 
        Here, we will have the detailed learning of creating and using user-defined packages. </p>
